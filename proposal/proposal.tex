\section{Motivation}

% What problem are you tackling? Is this an application or a theoretical result?

\textbf{Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)} is a range of neurodevelopmental disorders including classical autism, Asperger syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), characterized by impaired social skills, repetitive behaviors, sensory issues, and language delay. More than 1\% of the population falls into this spectrum, with a high imbalance between the sexes, males being 4 to 5 times more likely to be affected than females\cite{defautism}.\\

The high heterogeneity of ASD makes it hard to define diagnostic criteria that can be applied to identify affected children as soon as possible to select optimal treatments. Currently, ASD diagnosis involves long processes and multiple specialists’ evaluations, using behavioural assessment instruments. Application of Machine Learning methods to identify the underlying brain mechanisms could significantly speed up the diagnostic process.\cite{defautism}\cite{abide}\\

If the data allows it, it could also be interesting to identify the different manifestations of the disorder in females with respect to males, since females are known to have a completely different neuropathology, which could be a reason why they are less affected, or possibly just fail to be diagnosed using the current male-based criteria \cite{sexdiff}.


\section{Method}

% What machine learning techniques are you planning to apply or improve upon?

% Presenting pointers to one relevant dataset and one example of prior research on the topic are a valuable (optional) addition.

We have identified the \textbf{ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange)} project\cite{abide} which offers 2 different databases: the older ABIDE I containing 1112 datasets, including 539 from individuals with ASD and 573 from typical controls, for which the Preprocessed Connectomes Project created a pre-processing script \cite{preprocabide}\cite{neuroimg}, and the newer and better-characterized ABIDE II database \cite{abide2}, collecting 1114 datasets from 521 individuals with ASD and 593 controls.\\

We haven’t yet decided which one to use, since at this stage we don’t know what pre-processing entails and if it would be a significant (and allowed) advantage to start from there, and if it’s worth it despite the fact that the ABIDE II database might be of better quality. For instance, a previous work \cite{guidelinesml} using the ABIDE I data concluded that there weren’t enough female samples there to perform a comparative analysis, and actually proceeded to discard those minority samples from their training set.\\

Previous Machine Learning research on this topic\cite{guidelinesml} has pointed to some of the most effective learning algorithms used when working on image data for these purposes: we could explore Support Vector Machines and Gaussian Naïve Bayes.\\

\section{Intended Experiments}

% What experiments are you planning to run? How do you plan to evaluate your machine learning algorithm?

We plan on testing the performance of our built model by applying k-fold cross-validation.
We repute this step necessary in order to check for possible overfitting over the data, which is common given its natural high number of features per sample.  Our goal therefore remains to maximize the final testing accuracy.\\

In order to explore the differences between male and female subjects we could train separate models on the two partitions of our dataset to compare performance and overall accuracy when testing each model with samples of the same versus the opposite gender.
